STATUS      DESCRIPTION
            handle errorData in serial driver and UI
            show clearBtn in UI when serial driver mode is ERROR

            Create passable settings from UI to mega: nudge_time, nudge amplitude, etc. 
            Manual Modes: jog forward and jog negative with percent power.
            study dead time between encoder readings to know if i can afford to send info updates and diagnostic data
            phase out serial_output cmd for diagnostic data and use info_cmd with InfoTypes::DIAGNOSTIC_DATA instead
DONE        Verify from older code that the pd control law error uses degrees and not revs
            Homing Sequence 
DONE        DEBUG: diagnostic output keeps printing ~~, possible issue with data recording during shifting, try sending pre-filled array with value 13s
DONE        ROS2 Node Driver for UI
DONE        DEBUG: encoder not providing accurate readings
DONE        DEBUG: when mega powers it up prints out something weird with an 'f' at the beginnning, won't connect to serial driver

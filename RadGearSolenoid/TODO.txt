STATUS      DESCRIPTION
            Send i/o status to UI (should already be sent with status)
Testing     Debug: velocity is off, might want to base it off of true scan times instead of avg
            handle errorData in serial driver and UI
            show clearBtn in UI when serial driver mode is ERROR

            Create passable settings from UI to mega: nudge_time, nudge amplitude, etc. 
            Manual Modes: jog forward and jog negative with percent power.
DONE        study dead time between encoder readings to know if i can afford to send info updates and diagnostic data: you can afford it
            phase out serial_output cmd for diagnostic data and use info_cmd with InfoTypes::DIAGNOSTIC_DATA instead
DONE        Verify from older code that the pd control law error uses degrees and not revs
Testing     Homing Sequence 
DONE        DEBUG: diagnostic output keeps printing ~~, possible issue with data recording during shifting, try sending pre-filled array with value 13s
DONE        ROS2 Node Driver for UI
DONE        DEBUG: encoder not providing accurate readings
DONE        DEBUG: when mega powers it up prints out something weird with an 'f' at the beginnning, won't connect to serial driver
